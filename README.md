## Overview
Goal: Create a product preview card component using html and css. 
Scope: Create a product preview card component that summarizes a product with a button to 
       add the product. There is no functionality built into the button to add to a cart.
       The component will highlight a product for a user that wants to look at a product and decide if they would like to buy it.
Approach: The component will be built using html and css with the text editor vscode.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
I started with writing out the plan and design of the component. I recommend doing these steps and not leaving them out. As I was writing out the plan and design it forced me to think about how the component would be layed out and how the responsiveness would be. As I wrote out code I noticed multiple ways of laying out the component and deciding which one would be best took some time. I noticed another solution right at the end of making the component. I will have to chalk this up to learning.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I keep seeing a pattern of finding different ways of doing things. The main challenge for me was to go from mobile to desktop. I normally work the other way around. Also, I noticed that the border-radius didn't function the way I thought it would. I had to use overflow: hidden to hide the corners of the img div and the product preview div. I didn't have to do this in my other projects. Is it because I used a mobile first approach? I don't think it should matter but it is something to keep in mind. Also, I notice that my attribution div likes to move from the bottom to the top so this is something I will tackle in the beginning on my next project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>None</h1>
```
```css
 none
```
```js
 no js written
```

### Continued development

I need to keep working on mobile first approach and find some videos to watch on Youtube. I believe I'm missing some key best practices so before my next project I will find out what mobile first approach is.
